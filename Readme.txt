If you are going to work on our project i.e; Social blogging app, then use the file with name "complete_source_code.zip" which is a working application.

Once you add all the required vulnerabilities, then you need to make use of the file "project_template.zip" in which application folder should contain all the client, server, test folders of the project.

Please note that React version of the project should be 15.
